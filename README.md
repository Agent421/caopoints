  <p>The tool quickly outputs the lowest grade you can get in a number of subjects that will give you enough points for a certain course.</p>
    <p>
        When I was an Irish Leaving cert student it was frustrating and time-consuming to calculate an ideal
        grade requirement to reach a CAO points target.
    </p>
    <p>So I created this tool.</p>
    <p>The tool quickly outputs the lowest grade you can get in a number of subjects that will give you enough
        points for a certain course.</p>
    <p>The tool saves time as it may be time-consuming to calculate a grade combination that you are
        comfortable with.</p>
    <p>For example, imagine trying to find easy ways to score 400 CAO points with 4 higher levels and 2
        ordinary level subjects. The amount of trial and error needed would frustrate anyone.</p>
    <p>The tool also completely <strong>FREE</strong> to use and doesn't retain any of
        the user's inputted information.</p>
    <strong>TLDR; The tool saves students' time, stress, and money.</strong>
